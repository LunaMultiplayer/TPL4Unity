Please write the code as you were going to leave it, return after 1 year and you'd have to understand what you wrote.
It's very important that the code is clean and documented so in case someone leaves, another programmer could take and maintain it. 
Bear in mind that nobody likes to take a project where it's code looks like a dumpster.

There's also a test project in case you want to add tests to your code.
